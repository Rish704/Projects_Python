# Projects_Python
Hello there!!
These are my first ever projects on github.
These projects include two games i.e. "Snake Water Gun game" and "The perfect guess" based entirely on python.
The two basic initial projects pave the way to more awesome projects coming soon on this repository.
A new project as Library Management System is being added and worked upon to store the database of the students.
